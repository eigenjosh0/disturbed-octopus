# disturbed-octopus
A late night side project started by me in August of 2018.
The goal is to automate catalogging of my Spotify playlist, Desiderata
How I plan on doing this is to loop through the playlist and on each artist or song, have a program execute a Google search and return data such as genre, albums produced by the artist and so on.
At present(8/13), I expect to build the application using Node.js and ASP.NET.
