# disturbed-octopus
A late night side project started by me in August of 2018.
The goal is to automate catalogging of my Spotify playlist, Desiderata.
How I plan on doing this is to loop through the playlist and on each artist or song, have a program execute a Google (or other search engine) search and return data such as genre, albums produced by the artist and so on.
At present(8/13), I expect to build the application using Node.js, Python and ASP.NET.

DISCLAIMER:
I do not intend to waste resources by creating this program, thus I want to make it clear that I understand the problem with SERP Crawling/Scraping and that I intend only to use this as a project to further my understanding of automation and programming in general. Any usage of the code or practices found in disturbed-octopus is allowed by me since this is a public repository, but I want to make it thoroughly clear that the procedures are not generally looked upon with unconditional approval by Google and other search engines. In closing, if you decide to use any code from this project for personal financial gain or anything other than to further your sole personal understanding of programming, IT IS NOT APPROVED BY THE AUTHOR.
